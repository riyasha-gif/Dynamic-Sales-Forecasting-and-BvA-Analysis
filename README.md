This project involves a comprehensive Budget vs. Actual (BvA) analysis delivered via an interactive Excel dashboard to identify 
critical strategic flaws and forecast profit recovery opportunities.

Key Highlights & Results:

Identified Major Q4 Performance Gap: 
Audited Q4 performance against a 10% growth budget, revealing a -$148K Sales Variance and a -$17K Profit Variance.
Isolated Root Cause: 
Proved that a systemic, loss-making discount strategy is the primary driver of margin erosion, creating an annual -$412K Profit Loss.
Actionable Recommendation: 
Defined an immediate Profit Opportunity of $412,582 through the cessation of loss-making discounts, alongside a targeted audit on the underperforming Technology category.

Technical Skills Demonstrated:

Dynamic Data Modeling: 
Constructed a flexible data model using Pivot Tables and Calculated Fields to enable multi-year BvA analysis.
Interactive Dashboarding:
Developed a single-screen dashboard featuring fully functional Slicers (Market, Segment, Category) to facilitate dynamic drill-down into performance and root cause.
Visual Communication: 
Created high-impact visuals, including a Combo Chart (Sales/Profit BvA) and a Doughnut Chart (Profit-Loss breakdown) to synthesize complex financial data into clear management actions.
